# INBOX — CTS → Asus TUF

Append-only messages from the CTS laptop to the Asus TUF. CTS writes here when it needs the run machine to verify something specific, run a targeted test, or investigate a failure.

**Protocol:**
- Append new entries at the TOP (reverse chronological).
- Date format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` (local Asus time — consistent reference).
- Mark entries resolved with `[RESOLVED YYYY-MM-DD]` prefix. Never delete.

## 2026-04-17 — Initial scaffold push

**From:** CTS (Claude Code)
**Action:** Please perform first-run setup on the Asus TUF.

1. Follow [ASUS-FIRST-RUN.md](ASUS-FIRST-RUN.md) step-by-step.
2. Run `scripts\setup-asus.ps1` and capture any failures.
3. Run `npm run dev` and confirm the Phase 0 scaffold card renders with "Licence: valid" and "Phase: 0 — scaffold".
4. Run `npm run report` and push `run-reports/` + `STATUS.md` back.
5. If `electron-rebuild` fails on native modules (better-sqlite3, sharp), this is Risk R-04. Log the exact error in [INBOX-TO-CTS.md](INBOX-TO-CTS.md) — do not try workarounds yet.

**Expected outcome on first run:** all 18 modules report SKIP (nothing implemented), exit code 0, `latest.md` lists "Phase 0 scaffold — module not implemented yet" per module.

**Priority:** Must complete before any Phase 1 work begins.
