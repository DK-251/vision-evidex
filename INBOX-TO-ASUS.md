# INBOX — CTS → Asus TUF

Append-only messages from the CTS laptop to the Asus TUF. CTS writes here when it needs the run machine to verify something specific, run a targeted test, or investigate a failure.

**Protocol:**
- Append new entries at the TOP (reverse chronological).
- Date format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` (local Asus time — consistent reference).
- Mark entries resolved with `[RESOLVED YYYY-MM-DD]` prefix. Never delete.

## 2026-04-18 — Please verify new dependency-audit step in `npm run report`

**From:** CTS (Claude Code)
**Action:** Validate that the modified [scripts/run-report.js](scripts/run-report.js) behaves correctly on the Asus TUF.

Changes in this push:
1. `run-report.js` now shells out to `npm audit --omit=dev --json` and records counts in:
   - `run-reports/latest.json` → new `dependencyAudit` field
   - `run-reports/latest.md` → new "Dependency audit (prod)" section
   - `run-reports/benchmarks.jsonl` → new `audit` key per line
2. Next-action line is appended when `high > 0` or `critical > 0` (currently expected: 5 high).
3. Exit code logic is **unchanged** — audit findings never FAIL the run. Only `modules[].status==='FAIL'` gates exit 1.
4. Three Phase 1 security gates added to [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md).

**Please run on Asus:**
1. `npm run report`
2. Confirm exit 0, `latest.md` shows 18 SKIP + the new dependency-audit table with non-zero high count.
3. Confirm `benchmarks.jsonl` last line contains `"audit":{...}`.
4. Push back `run-reports/` + `STATUS.md` as usual.

**Priority:** Do before first Phase 1 Week 3 commits so the trend baseline starts recording immediately.

## 2026-04-17 — Initial scaffold push

**From:** CTS (Claude Code)
**Action:** Please perform first-run setup on the Asus TUF.

1. Follow [ASUS-FIRST-RUN.md](ASUS-FIRST-RUN.md) step-by-step.
2. Run `scripts\setup-asus.ps1` and capture any failures.
3. Run `npm run dev` and confirm the Phase 0 scaffold card renders with "Licence: valid" and "Phase: 0 — scaffold".
4. Run `npm run report` and push `run-reports/` + `STATUS.md` back.
5. If `electron-rebuild` fails on native modules (better-sqlite3, sharp), this is Risk R-04. Log the exact error in [INBOX-TO-CTS.md](INBOX-TO-CTS.md) — do not try workarounds yet.

**Expected outcome on first run:** all 18 modules report SKIP (nothing implemented), exit code 0, `latest.md` lists "Phase 0 scaffold — module not implemented yet" per module.

**Priority:** Must complete before any Phase 1 work begins.
